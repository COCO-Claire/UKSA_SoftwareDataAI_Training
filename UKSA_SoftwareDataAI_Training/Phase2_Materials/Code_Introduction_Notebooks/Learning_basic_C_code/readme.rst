# Notebooks on C

Attached here are some C notebookes as a refresher.  

C is not needed for the majority of the course and will not be needed for all delegates.  However, if you wish to deploy ML models to a small microcontroller such as an arduino then some C code will be needed. These basic notebooks will provide a code overview that can be used also as a reference. 

### These notebooks:

Usually c programs are .c files compiled on the terminal. Scripting lanaguages are the ones often used with jupyter notebooks. However, it is possible to install a C kernel for your jupyter notebook and this gives a nice format for interacting with the language, especially when you might want to switch between C and python when prototyping code. The .yaml file provided for this course will install a C kernel for your own jupyter lab environment but you can also use `google colab <https://colab.research.google.com>`_ (with a small sysntax change where the program is saved and run in two steps) to run these codes. 

There are two of each notebook - one is labelled 'colab' - this can be run in colab (the c compilers are already installed and avalible there)

* 1 - a series of 'hello world' exmaples showing off basic information about the syntax. Remember with C - define everything and be careful with your puntuation!
* 2 - exploring basic datatypes
* 3 - using operators
* 4 - using loops and ocnditionals

If you wish to deploy code to an arduino you will want to install the arduino IDE: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software
