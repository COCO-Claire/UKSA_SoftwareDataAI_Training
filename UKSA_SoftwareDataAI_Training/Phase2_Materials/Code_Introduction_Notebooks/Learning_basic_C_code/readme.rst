# Notebooks on C

Attached here are some C notebookes as a refresher.  

C is not needed for the majoiryt of the course and will not be needed for all delegates.  However, if you wish to deploy ML models to a small microcontroller such as an arduino then some C code will be needed. These basic notebooks will provide a code overview that can be used also as a reference. 

Other excellent and free learning resources for learning basic C are:
w3schools: https://www.w3schools.com/c/
geeksforgeeks: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-programming-language/

If you wish to deploy code to an arduino you will want to install the arduino IDE: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software
And there are plenty of excellent tutorials here: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/HomePage
